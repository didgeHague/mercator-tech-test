## sbt project compiled with Scala 3

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).

### Tech test
I have made the following assumptions:

* The total price can be displayed in pence
* Items can be added in a case-insensitive manner
